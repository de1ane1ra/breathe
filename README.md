://breathe is a visual representation of and reminder to breathe.

I realized not too long ago that a deep breath is something I was immensely in need of. Something I did not do enough.
It a damn shame that such a simple relief and pleasure had gone ignored in my life for so long.

It has very few features:  
1. Breathe
2. Swap color-scheme for preference or time of day.
3. Presented in glorious monochrome.
